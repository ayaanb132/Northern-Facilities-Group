## The Client

Van Horne Construction is a trusted name in construction and development. Their head office serves as the nerve centre for project management, client meetings, and operations—and their reputation depends on both a professional corporate environment and spotless post-construction handovers.

## The Challenge

Before engaging NFG, Van Horne faced fragmented cleaning services: one provider for the head office, ad-hoc arrangements for post-construction cleans, and no single standard or reporting view. That led to inconsistent quality, last-minute scrambles before handovers, and extra time spent coordinating multiple vendors instead of focusing on delivery.

They needed a partner who could:

- Maintain their **head office** to a level that reflects their brand and impresses clients and staff.
- **Spearhead post-construction janitorial** across project sites—final cleans, punch-list support, and handover readiness—so keys could be handed over with confidence.
- Provide **one point of contact**, one set of standards, and clear reporting for both office and sites.

## Our Approach

### Head Office Program

We designed a dedicated head-office program tailored to how Van Horne uses their space: high-traffic common areas, executive and project offices, meeting rooms, and shared amenities. We established:

- **Daily and weekly protocols** aligned to their schedule and occupancy.
- **Dedicated account management** so there’s always a single point of contact.
- **Real-time reporting** so facility and operations teams have full visibility without chasing multiple vendors.

### Post-Construction Janitorial

We took the lead on post-construction janitorial so Van Horne could treat it as a turnkey service:

- **Final cleans** after trades complete, so spaces are ready for client walkthroughs and handover.
- **Punch-list support** so any cleaning-related items are addressed quickly and to a consistent standard.
- **Handover readiness** so when keys are handed over, the space meets the same high bar Van Horne expects from their own head office.

We aligned with their site schedules, safety requirements (including WHMIS and site-specific protocols), and timelines so that cleaning never holds up delivery.

## The Results

- **Single partner** for head office and post-construction janitorial—one contract, one standard, one point of contact.
- **Consistent, construction-grade standards** across head office and all sites.
- **Faster turnover** between trades and handover, with NFG-led post-construction cleans.
- **Full visibility** via real-time reporting for the head office and site-by-site status where applicable.
- **Zero compliance or safety incidents**; all work delivered in line with WHMIS and site protocols.

Today, Van Horne’s head office presents the professionalism their brand demands, and their project sites benefit from NFG spearheading post-construction janitorial so they can focus on what they do best: building.
