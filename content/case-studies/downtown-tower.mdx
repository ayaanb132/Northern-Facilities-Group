## The Challenge

Premier Properties' downtown tower had struggled with cleaning quality for years. Previous vendors provided inconsistent service, staff turnover was high, and there was no reliable way to verify that work was being completed to standard.

Resident complaints were frequent, and the property management team was spending significant time managing cleaning issues rather than focusing on other aspects of building operations.

## Our Approach

After a comprehensive walkthrough and needs assessment, we proposed an Enterprise service package with several key elements:

1. **Dedicated Site Supervisor**: A full-time supervisor manages the cleaning team, conducts quality inspections, and serves as the primary contact for property management.

2. **Custom Protocols**: We developed cleaning protocols specific to the tower's premium finishes, high-traffic patterns, and resident expectations.

3. **Real-Time Reporting**: Our digital dashboard gives property management instant visibility into completed tasks, quality scores, and any issues.

4. **Proactive Communication**: Regular check-ins with property management and quarterly presentations to the condo board.

## The Results

Within three months, the transformation was evident. Resident satisfaction scores improved dramatically, complaints dropped to near-zero, and property management regained hours previously spent managing cleaning issues.

The improved common area appearance also contributed to successful unit sales and rentals, with prospects commenting on the building's well-maintained presentation.
