slug: "van-horne-construction-post-construction-cleaning"
client: "Van Horne Construction Ltd."
propertyType: "office"
summary: "Northern Facilities Group supports Van Horne Construction Ltd. with a dual-scope program: consistent head office janitorial standards and post-construction cleaning leadership across project sites in Ontario."
challenge: "Van Horne needed a head office janitorial program that stayed consistent and a post-construction cleaning partner that could lead site cleaning to a repeatable standard without disrupting trades or turnover. Prior to NFG, the scope was fragmented across vendors, quality varied, and operations had to coordinate cleaning under deadline pressure."
solution: "We built one program covering head office janitorial and post-construction cleaning, with defined stages, QA loops, and scheduling aligned to trade turnover and walkthrough readiness."
results:
  - "One partner covering head office janitorial and post-construction cleaning under one standard"
  - "More consistent handover-ready finish quality across sites"
  - "Reduced last-minute scramble by aligning cleans to trade turnover and walkthrough schedules"
  - "Clear visibility across office and site workstreams"
